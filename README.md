# Age-Calculator-using-Python-Tkinter
In this age calculator app, users can type in their date of birth, and the app will calculate and display their age.

You will learn to use some excellent libraries as well. Python has a library called datetime, which helps do operations on date and time. The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times in both simple and complex ways. So, using this library, the age of a person can be easily found out with a few lines of code.

Python inserts images into the app with the help of a library called Pillow, which is also known as the Python Imaging Library (PIL). You will learn to use this library by doing this project.

PIL is a free library for the Python programming language that adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.
